 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employment;
 The provided table schema does not contain a table that explicitly represents "employees". However, I assume that the "employment" table represents the relationship between companies and their employees. Therefore, to count the number of employees, we can count the distinct "People_ID" in the "employment" table. Here is the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT People_ID) FROM employment; ```;
 SELECT Name FROM employee ORDER BY Age ASC;
 SELECT Name FROM employee ORDER BY Age ASC;
 SELECT COUNT(*) as number_of_employees, city FROM employees GROUP BY city;
 SELECT City, COUNT(Employee_ID) AS Number_of_Employees FROM employee GROUP BY City;

 SELECT Manager_name, District FROM shop WHERE Number_products = (SELECT MAX(Number_products) FROM shop);
 SELECT MIN(Number_of_product_category) AS Minimum_Products, MAX(Number_of_product_category) AS Maximum_Products FROM store;
 Since there is no table named "products" or any column that indicates the number of products in any of the given tables, I cannot provide a SQL query for the given English query. Please provide the relevant table schema or update the English query accordingly.;
 Unfortunately, there is no table in the provided schema that contains information about individual shops and their products. Therefore, it's not possible to generate a SQL query based on the given English query.  However, if there were a table named "shops" with columns "name", "location", "district", and "num_of_products", the SQL query would look like this:  ```sql SELECT name, location, district FROM shops ORDER BY num_of_products DESC; ```  Please provide the correct schema or table structure to generate the appropriate SQL query.;
 SELECT Name, Location, District FROM shop ORDER BY Number_products DESC;
 SELECT Store_Name FROM store WHERE Number_of_product_category > (SELECT AVG(Number_of_product_category) FROM store);
 Assuming that the "shops" refer to the "market" table and the "number products" refer to the "Num_of_shops" column, the SQL query would be:  SELECT District FROM market WHERE Num_of_shops > (SELECT AVG(Num_of_shops) FROM market);
 SELECT Name FROM employee WHERE Employee_ID IN (SELECT Employee_ID FROM evaluation GROUP BY Employee_ID ORDER BY COUNT(Year_awarded) DESC LIMIT 1);
 SELECT e.Name FROM employee e JOIN evaluation ev ON e.Employee_ID = ev.Employee_ID GROUP BY e.Name ORDER BY COUNT(ev.Year_awarded) DESC LIMIT 1;
 SELECT Employee_ID, MAX(Bonus) FROM evaluation GROUP BY Employee_ID ORDER BY MAX(Bonus) DESC LIMIT 1;  Note: This query will return the Employee_ID of the employee who got the highest one-time bonus. To get the name of the employee, you would need to join the evaluation table with the employee table using the Employee_ID. However, since the employee table schema is not provided, I can't provide the exact query for that.;
 SELECT employee.name FROM employee JOIN evaluation ON employee.Employee_ID = evaluation.Employee_ID WHERE evaluation.Bonus = (SELECT MAX(Bonus) FROM evaluation);
 SELECT Name FROM employee WHERE Employee_ID NOT IN (SELECT Employee_ID FROM evaluation);
 SELECT Name FROM employee WHERE Employee_ID NOT IN (SELECT Employee_ID FROM evaluation);
 This query cannot be answered directly as there is no table that associates the number of employees with the shop. However, assuming that the number of employees is related to the number of products in the shop (which is not a safe assumption), you can use the following query:  `SELECT Name FROM shop WHERE Number_products = (SELECT MAX(Num_of_employees) FROM market);`  Please note that this query assumes that the `Num_of_employees` in the `market` table corresponds to the `Number_products` in the `shop` table, which is not a valid assumption without further context.  If the number of employees is stored in a separate table, you would need to join that table with the `shop` table and then find the shop with the maximum number of employees.;
 SELECT Name FROM shop WHERE Num_of_staff = (SELECT MAX(Num_of_staff) FROM shop);
 SELECT Name FROM shop WHERE Shop_ID NOT IN (SELECT Shop_ID FROM employee);
 SELECT shop.Name FROM shop WHERE shop.Num_of_staff = 0;

 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the provided table schema, there is no table named "hiring" or any related tables that contain information about hiring.

 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no direct relationship between the template type code and the document name. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a SQL query to retrieve the template type code of the template used by a document named "Data base".  However, if you have a table that links the template type code to the document name, you can use a query similar to the following:  ```sql SELECT Template_Type_Code FROM Ref_Template_Types WHERE Template_Type_Code IN (SELECT Template_Type_Code FROM Document_Template_Mapping WHERE Document_Name = 'Data base'); ```  Please note that this is just an example and assumes that there is a table named `Document_Template_Mapping` that maps the document name to the template type code.

 Unfortunately, the provided table schema does not contain any information about documents or paragraphs. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a SQL query to count the number of paragraphs in a document named 'Summer Show' based on the given schema.  Please provide the relevant table schema with the necessary information to generate the desired SQL query.;
 Unfortunately, there is no table named "paragraph" in the provided schema, so it is not possible to generate a valid SQL query to retrieve details for a paragraph with the text 'Korea'. Please provide the correct table schema or the name of the table that contains the paragraph details.  If the table that contains paragraph details is named "paragraphs" with columns "id", "text", and "details", the SQL query would look like this:  `SELECT details FROM paragraphs WHERE text = 'Korea';`;
 Since there is no table named "paragraph" or similar in the provided schema, I assume that you want to find records containing the text 'Korea ' in the `draft_details` column of the `Document_Drafts` table. Here's the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT * FROM Document_Drafts WHERE draft_details LIKE '%Korea %'; ```;
 This query cannot be answered directly as there is no relation between the "Paragraphs" table and the document name, and there is no table named "Documents" in the provided schema.

 SELECT first_name, birth_date FROM players WHERE country_code = 'USA';
 SELECT first_name, birth_date FROM players WHERE country_code = 'USA';
 Assuming that the "player" table has a column "age" and the "manager" table has columns "year" and "w" (wins) and "l" (losses), and that the current year is used to calculate the age, the query could look like this:  ```sql SELECT AVG(CASE WHEN l > w THEN age ELSE NULL END) AS avg_age_losers, AVG(CASE WHEN w > l THEN age ELSE NULL END) AS avg_age_winners FROM manager JOIN player ON manager.player_id = player.player_id WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - manager.year = player.age; ```;
 This query assumes that the "player" table has a "birth_year" column and "matches" table has a "winner_player_id" and "loser_player_id" columns. Since there's no "matches" table in the provided schema, the query is based on an assumed table structure.  ```sql SELECT   'Winners' AS group_name,   AVG(2022 - pw.birth_year) AS average_age FROM   player pw   JOIN matches m ON pw.player_id = m.winner_player_id UNION ALL SELECT   'Losers' AS group_name,   AVG(2022 - pl.birth_year) AS average_age FROM   player pl   JOIN matches m ON pl.player_id = m.loser_player_id; ```;

 This query cannot be answered with the provided tables as there is no table that directly links players to winning a competition or a postseason. Additionally, there is no table that links players to specific years they played in. However, assuming that the "team\_id\_winner" in the "postseason" table represents the players who played for the winning team, the following query can be used to list the team\_ids of winners who played in both 2013 and 2016:  `SELECT team_id_winner FROM postseason WHERE year IN (2013, 2016) GROUP BY team_id_winner HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT year) = 2;`  Note: This query will only return the team\_ids, not the names of the winners. To get the names, you would need a table that links the team\_id to player\_id and another table that links player\_id to player\_name.;
 SELECT player FROM player WHERE Player_ID IN (SELECT player_id FROM manager WHERE year = 2013 AND w > l) AND Player_ID IN (SELECT player_id FROM manager WHERE year = 2016 AND w > l);

 Assuming that the "left / L hand" information is stored in the "people" table under a column named "Handedness" and that the "player" table has a foreign key referencing the "People_ID" in the "people" table, the SQL query would look like this:  ```sql SELECT p.Name AS first_name, NULL AS last_name FROM people p JOIN player pl ON p.People_ID = pl.People_ID WHERE p.Handedness = 'L' ORDER BY p.Birth_Date; ```  This query assumes that the "Name" column in the "people" table contains the first name only, and there is no separate column for the last name. If there is a separate column for the last name, you can modify the query accordingly.  Please note that the actual column names and table relationships may vary, and the query should be adjusted based on the actual schema of your database.;
 SELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name as full_name FROM players WHERE hand = 'left' ORDER BY birth_date;
 Given the provided tables, it seems there is no direct way to find the "first name and country code of the player who did the most number of tours" because there is no table that directly links the player's name to the number of tours they have done.  However, based on the available tables, we can make an assumption that the "number of tours" could be interpreted as the "number of games managed" by a player in the "manager" and "manager_half" tables.  Here is a query that returns the player's name and country code (assuming the country code is in the "Nationality" column of the "people" table) who has managed the most games. This query assumes that the "player_id" in the "manager" table is the same as the "id" in the "Player" table and the "People_ID" in the "people" table.  ```sql SELECT p.player_name, pp.Nationality FROM Player p JOIN (     SELECT player_id, COUNT(*) as total_games     FROM manager     GROUP BY player_id     ORDER BY total_games DESC     LIMIT 1 ) m ON m.player_id = p.id JOIN people pp ON pp.People_ID = p.id; ```  Please note that this query might not work as expected if the assumptions made about the relationships between the tables are incorrect. You may need to adjust the query based on your actual database schema.;
 The given information does not include a table that contains information about a player's first name and country code. However, assuming that the `player` table contains the first name and the `team` table contains the country code, and that the number of tours is represented by the `Years_Played` column, here is a SQL query that could answer the question:  ```sql SELECT p.Player, t.country_code FROM player p JOIN team t ON p.Team = t.Team_id ORDER BY CAST(p.Years_Played AS INT) DESC LIMIT 1; ```  Please note that this query assumes that the `Years_Played` column in the `player` table contains a number of years as a string, and that the `team` table has a `country_code` column. If these assumptions are incorrect, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly. Also, this query will return the player with the highest number of years played, which may not necessarily be the same as the player with the most tours if the definition of a "tour" is something other than a year of play.  The query also assumes that the `Player` column contains the first name of the player. If it contains the full name, you would need to split it to get the first name. This could be done using string functions, but the specific function would depend on the SQL dialect you are using.  Finally, the query assumes that the `Team` column in the `player` table and the `Team_id` column in the `team` table are both text data types. If they are not, you would need to adjust the data types in the `JOIN` clause accordingly.;

 SELECT year, COUNT(*) as match_count FROM batting GROUP BY year ORDER BY match_count DESC LIMIT 1;
 This query assumes that the "player_award_vote" table contains information about award winners, and the "points_won" column represents the number of times a player has won an award. Also, it assumes that the "player" table contains the "name" column for player's name.  The query also assumes that the "team_id" in the "player_award_vote" table matches the "team_id" in the "team_half" table, and the "team_id" in the "team_half" table matches the "Club_ID" in the "club_rank" table.  ```sql SELECT p.name, cr.Rank AS rank_points FROM player_award_vote AS pav JOIN player AS p ON p.player_id = pav.player_id JOIN team_half AS th ON th.team_id = pav.team_id JOIN club_rank AS cr ON cr.Club_ID = th.team_id WHERE pav.award_id = 'winner' GROUP BY p.name, cr.Rank ORDER BY SUM(pav.points_won) DESC LIMIT 1; ```;

 Unfortunately, the provided tables do not contain information about matches with winners and losers, so it is not possible to determine the names of the winner and loser who played in the longest match. However, if we assume that the "match" table contains the duration of each match, the SQL query to find the winner and loser of the longest match would look something like this:  SELECT p1.first\_name || ' ' || p1.last\_name AS winner\_name, p2.first\_name || ' ' || p2.last\_name AS loser\_name FROM match m JOIN players p1 ON m.winning\_pilot = p1.player\_id JOIN players p2 ON m.losing\_pilot = p2.player\_id ORDER BY m.duration DESC LIMIT 1;  Note that this query assumes that there is a "losing\_pilot" column in the "match" table that references the "player\_id" column in the "players" table. If such a column does not exist, the query would need to be modified accordingly.  Since the "match" table provided does not contain any information about winners or losers, a query cannot be written to answer the given question.;
 SELECT player.Player, AVG(manager_half.rank) as Average_Ranking FROM player INNER JOIN manager_half ON player.Player_ID = manager_half.player_id GROUP BY player.Player;

 This query cannot be answered directly as there is no direct relationship between the tables "match", "match_result", "club_rank", "player", and "player\_award\_vote" to find the first name, country code, and birth date of the winner who has the highest rank points in all matches. However, I can provide a query that could be used as a starting point, assuming that the "Winning\_Pilot" in the "match" table corresponds to the "Player\_ID" in the "player" table and the "Rank" in the "match\_result" table corresponds to the "Rank" in the "club\_rank" table:  `SELECT p.Player, p.Years_Played AS Country_Code, p.Total_WL AS Birth_Date FROM player p JOIN (SELECT m.Winning_Pilot, SUM(mr.Points) AS Total_Points FROM match m JOIN match_result mr ON m.Round = mr.Rank GROUP BY m.Winning_Pilot ORDER BY Total_Points DESC LIMIT 1) q ON p.Player_ID = q.Winning_Pilot;`  Please note that this query assumes that the "Years\_Played" column in the "player" table corresponds to the country code and the "Total\_WL" column corresponds to the birth date. However, these assumptions may not be correct, and the query may need to be adjusted based on the actual relationships between the tables and the data.;

 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there seems to be no table or field related to "ships" or "Captured". Therefore, I cannot provide a SQL query for the given English query. Please provide the correct table schema or context for the required query.;

 Unfortunately, the provided tables do not contain enough information to calculate the average number of injuries caused each time. However, based on the given table schema, I can provide a query to calculate the average number of injuries per game using the `injury_accident` and `game` tables.

 Unfortunately, the provided table schema does not contain information about the department of each degree. Therefore, I cannot generate a query to answer the question "How many degrees does the engineering department have?".  To answer this question, you would need a table that links degrees to departments or a table that includes a department column in the degrees table.  If such a table existed, for example:  CREATE TABLE degrees ( Year number PRIMARY KEY, Campus number, Department text, Degrees number, FOREIGN KEY(Campus) REFERENCES Campuses(Id) );  The query would look like this:  SELECT SUM(Degrees) FROM degrees WHERE Department = 'Engineering';

 This query cannot be answered directly as there is no information about students' addresses or their registration in degree programs in the provided table schema.  Assuming that there is a table named "students_address" with a column "state" and a table named "registration" with a column "student_id", the query could look like this:  ```sql SELECT s.name FROM student s LEFT JOIN registration r ON s.ID = r.student_id WHERE s.state = 'North Carolina' AND r.student_id IS NULL; ```  However, this is a hypothetical query and might not work as the actual table schema and relationships between tables are not provided.;

 I'm sorry for the confusion, but there seems to be no table in the provided schema that contains information about individuals' phone numbers or names. Therefore, I cannot provide a valid SQL query to retrieve the phone number of the man named Timmothy Ward. Please provide the relevant table schema or information to generate the appropriate SQL query.;
 Assuming that the "mobile phone number" of a student is stored in the "Phone" column of the "Faculty" table (which is not a common scenario), and the student's name is stored in the "Fname" and "Lname" columns, the SQL query would be:  `SELECT Phone FROM Faculty WHERE Fname = 'Timmothy' AND Lname = 'Ward';`  However, if the "mobile phone number" of a student is stored in a different table or column, you would need to adjust the query accordingly.  Also, please note that the given table schema does not seem to have a table that directly links students to their phone numbers. The "Faculty" table seems to be for faculty members, not students. The "Student" table is not provided in the schema. Therefore, the above query might not return the desired result.  If the phone number is stored in a "Students" table, the query might look like this:  `SELECT Phone FROM Students WHERE Fname = 'Timmothy' AND Lname = 'Ward';`  Again, this assumes that the "Students" table has "Fname", "Lname", and "Phone" columns. Please adjust the query according to your actual table schema.;
 The provided schema does not contain a table that directly provides the required information. However, assuming that the "StuID" in the "Student" table is an auto-incrementing primary key, and the first student registered would have the lowest "StuID", you can use the following query:  ```sql SELECT Fname, STU_INIT, LName FROM Student WHERE StuID = (SELECT MIN(StuID) FROM Student); ```  This query selects the first name, middle name (assuming "STU_INIT" is the middle initial), and last name from the "Student" table where the "StuID" is the minimum value, which would be the first student registered.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no table that directly represents "students" or their registration information. Therefore, it is not possible to provide a SQL query to retrieve the first, middle, and last name of the first student to register.  Please provide the correct table schema or additional information to generate the appropriate SQL query.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no information about the graduation date or student's first, middle, and last names.

However, if we assume that there is a table named "Students" with columns "first\_name", "middle\_name", "last\_name", and "graduation\_date", then the SQL query could look like this: ```sql SELECT first_name, middle_name, last_name FROM Students ORDER BY graduation_date ASC LIMIT 1; ``` But again, this is just an assumption and the actual query would depend on the actual table schema.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no table that contains the necessary information to answer your question (first, middle, and last name of the earliest school graduate).

However, none of these tables have a column for graduation date or year, and the 'list' table does not seem to be related to the other tables.  Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query to answer your question with the given information. Please provide more details or correct table schema.;
 Assuming that the "current address" is stored in the `city_code` column of the `Student` table and the "permanent address" is not provided in the given schema, it is not possible to generate a valid SQL query for the given English query.  If we assume that the "permanent address" is stored in another column, let's say `permanent_city_code`, in the `Student` table, the SQL query would look like this:  ```sql SELECT Fname FROM Student WHERE city_code != permanent_city_code; ```;
 Assuming there is a table named "Students" with columns "StuID", "PermanentAddress" and "CurrentAddress", and another table named "StudentDetails" with columns "StuID" and "FirstName", the SQL query would be:  `SELECT StudentDetails.FirstName FROM Students INNER JOIN StudentDetails ON Students.StuID = StudentDetails.StuID WHERE Students.PermanentAddress != Students.CurrentAddress;`;
 SELECT address_id, COUNT(*) AS student_count, GROUP_CONCAT(STU_NUM) AS student_numbers FROM People_Addresses JOIN People ON People_Addresses.person_id = People.person_id JOIN ENROLL ON People.person_id = ENROLL.STU_NUM WHERE date_to IS NULL GROUP BY address_id ORDER BY student_count DESC LIMIT 1;

 Based on the provided table schema, there is no table that contains information about transcripts or their printing dates. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SQL query to answer the question "On average, when were the transcripts printed?".  However, if there was a table named "Transcripts" with a column "print_date" that stored the date when each transcript was printed, the SQL query to find the average printing date would be: ```sql SELECT AVG(print_date) FROM Transcripts; ```;
 SELECT AVG(transcript_date) FROM Transcripts;
 SELECT transcript_date, other_details FROM Transcripts ORDER BY transcript_date ASC LIMIT 1;
 Unfortunately, there is no "transcript release" table or column in the provided schema to generate a SQL query for the given English query. Please provide the correct table schema that includes the "transcript release" information.  If you have a table named "TranscriptRelease" with a schema like this: CREATE TABLE TranscriptRelease ( transcript_id number PRIMARY KEY, student_id number, release_date date, other_details text, );  Then, the SQL query would be: SELECT MIN(release_date) AS earliest_release_date, other_details FROM TranscriptRelease;
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Transcripts;
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Transcripts;
 Based on the provided table schema, there is no table that specifically stores transcript release dates. Therefore, I cannot generate a SQL query to retrieve the last transcript release date. Please provide the correct table schema or information that includes the transcript release date.;
 Since there is no table named "Transcript" in the provided schema, I cannot provide a SQL query for the question "When was the last transcript released?". However, assuming that the "Transcript" table exists and has a column named "release_date" or similar, you can use the following query to get the latest release date:  `SELECT MAX(release_date) FROM Transcript;`;
 SELECT student_course_id, COUNT(transcript_id) as transcript_count FROM Transcript_Contents GROUP BY student_course_id ORDER BY transcript_count DESC LIMIT 1;
 SELECT MAX(course_count) AS max_course_count, student_enrolment_id FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS course_count, student_enrolment_id FROM Transcript_Contents INNER JOIN Student_Enrolment_Courses USING (student_course_id) GROUP BY student_enrolment_id) GROUP BY student_enrolment_id ORDER BY max_course_count DESC LIMIT 1;
 SELECT transcript_date, transcript_id FROM Transcripts GROUP BY transcript_date, transcript_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC LIMIT 1;

 SELECT Semesters.semester_name FROM Semesters WHERE Semesters.semester_id IN (     SELECT DISTINCT Semesters.semester_id     FROM Semesters     JOIN ENROLL ON Semesters.semester_id = ENROLL.semester_id     JOIN Students ON ENROLL.STU_NUM = Students.student_id     JOIN People ON Students.student_id = People.person_id     WHERE People.first_name = 'Master' OR People.first_name = 'Bachelor' );
 SELECT Year FROM degrees WHERE Undergraduate > 0 AND Graduate > 0;
 The provided tables do not contain any information about student addresses. Therefore, it is not possible to answer the given question based on the provided table schema.  However, if there was a table named "Student_Addresses" with a "student_id" column, the query could be something like this:  `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT address) FROM Student_Addresses;`  This query assumes that the "Student_Addresses" table has a column named "address" that stores the address information for each student. The query counts the number of distinct addresses in the table, which would give the number of different addresses where the students currently live.;
 SELECT city_code FROM Student GROUP BY city_code;
 SELECT * FROM student ORDER BY name DESC;
 SELECT * FROM Student ORDER BY LName DESC, Fname DESC;
 DESCRIBE teaches;
 Given the provided table schema, there is no direct reference to a "section" or a field named "h". Assuming that "h" refers to a class code, and we want to find the course description for that class, we can use the following query:  ``` SELECT CRS_DESCRIPTION FROM COURSE WHERE CRS_CODE IN (SELECT CLASS_CODE FROM ENROLL WHERE CLASS_CODE = 'h'); ```;
 SELECT first_name FROM Students WHERE permanent_address_id IN (SELECT address_id FROM Addresses WHERE country = 'Haiti') OR cell_mobile_number = '09700166582';
 SELECT Fname FROM Student WHERE city_code = 'Haiti' OR Advisor = 09700166582;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but there seems to be no table named "cartoons" in the provided schema. Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query for listing the title of all cartoons in alphabetical order. Please provide the correct table schema for generating the required query.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but there is no table named "cartoons" or any table that contains "titles" in the provided schema. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a valid SQL query to answer your question based on the given information. Please provide the correct table schema or the appropriate query for your question.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided table schemas do not include a table that would allow us to answer the query about cartoons directed by "Ben Jones". Typically, a query like this would be answered using a table that includes information about cartoons, their directors, and possibly other related information.  However, based on the tables provided, here's a sample query to list all courses directed by "Ben Jones" (assuming "Ben Jones" is a faculty member and "CRS_CODE" is the course code):  ```sql SELECT CRS_CODE, CRS_DESCRIPTION FROM COURSE WHERE DEPT_CODE IN (SELECT DEPT_CODE FROM FACULTY WHERE FACULTY_NAME = 'Ben Jones'); ```  Please replace the table and column names with the actual ones in your database.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided table schemas do not contain any information about cartoons or directors. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a valid SQL query to answer the given English query. Please provide the correct table schema that includes the necessary information.;
 Unfortunately, there is no table in the provided schema that contains information about cartoons or their authors. Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query to answer your question.  However, if there was a table named "cartoons" with a column "author" and another table named "authors" with a column "name", the SQL query would look like this:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cartoons WHERE author = (SELECT ID FROM authors WHERE name = 'Joseph Kuhr'); ```;
 Unfortunately, there is no table in the provided schema that contains information about authors or cartoons. Therefore, it is impossible to generate a SQL query to answer the question "What is the number of cartoons written by Joseph Kuhr?".  Please provide the correct table schema that includes relevant information about authors and cartoons to generate the appropriate SQL query.;
 SELECT Title, Directed_by FROM Cartoon ORDER BY Original_air_date;
 SELECT Title, Directed_by FROM Cartoon ORDER BY Original_air_date;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there seems to be no direct relationship or table that stores information about cartoons and their directors. Therefore, I cannot provide a valid SQL query for your request.  However, if you have a table named 'Cartoons' with columns 'Title' and 'Director', the SQL query would look something like this:  ```sql SELECT Title FROM Cartoons WHERE Director = 'Ben Jones' OR Director = 'Brandon Vietti'; ```  Please provide the correct table schema if it's different from what you've given.;
 Unfortunately, the provided tables do not contain information about cartoons or directors. Therefore, it is impossible to write a SQL query to answer your question with the given tables. You would need a table containing cartoon titles and director information.;

 SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT title), COUNT(*) FROM tv_series;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but there seems to be no "TV Channel" table provided in your schema. However, based on the "TV_series" table, you can find out how many different series are listed. Here's the SQL query for that:  `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM TV_series;`  This query will return the number of distinct series in the "TV_series" table. Please note that without the "TV Channel" table, I can't provide a query for the number of different contents. If you meant something else by "contents", please provide more details.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but it seems there's no table in your schema that contains information about TV Channels or serial names like "Sky Radio". Therefore, I can't provide a valid SQL query for this request. Please provide the correct table schema or the correct query.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the table schema you provided does not contain any information about the content of the series Sky Radio. It seems that the tables are related to students, courses, degrees, and campuses.  If you have a table that contains information about the series Sky Radio, please provide the schema for that table, and I'd be happy to help you construct a SQL query.  However, based on the provided schema, here's an example of a SQL query that fetches all student details:  ```sql SELECT Students.student_id, Students.date_of_registration, Students.date_of_latest_logon, Students.login_name, Students.password, Students.personal_name, Students.middle_name, Students.family_name, Lives_in.dormid, Lives_in.room_number FROM Students JOIN Lives_in ON Students.student_id = Lives_in.stuid; ```  This query will return the student_id, date_of_registration, date_of_latest_logon, login_name, password, personal_name, middle_name, family_name of each student, along with the dormitory they live in and their room number.;
 SELECT Package_Option FROM TV_Channel WHERE series_name = 'Sky Radio';
 SELECT Package_Option FROM TV_Channel WHERE series_name = 'Sky Radio';
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no table that directly provides information about TV channels and their respective languages. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a valid SQL query for the given English query.  Please provide the relevant table schema to retrieve the desired information.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no table that represents TV channels or their languages. Therefore, I cannot provide a SQL query to answer the question "How many TV Channels use the English language?". Please provide the relevant table schema so I can assist you further.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no information about TV channels or languages. Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query for the given English query.  However, assuming you have a table named `TV_Channels` with schema:  ``` CREATE TABLE TV_Channels ( ChannelID number PRIMARY KEY, Language text, FOREIGN KEY(Language) REFERENCES Languages(Language) ); ```  Then the SQL query would be:  ```sql SELECT Language, COUNT(ChannelID) as NumberOfChannels FROM TV_Channels GROUP BY Language ORDER BY NumberOfChannels ASC LIMIT 1; ```;
 Given the provided table schema, there is no table that directly corresponds to TV Channels or languages used by those channels. Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query to answer your question based on the provided schema.  However, assuming that there is a table named "TV_Channels" with columns "channel_id", "channel_name", and "language", and a table named "Languages" with columns "language_id" and "language_name", you could use the following SQL query:  ```sql SELECT l.language_name, COUNT(t.channel_id) as channel_count FROM Languages l JOIN TV_Channels t ON l.language_id = t.language GROUP BY l.language_name ORDER BY channel_count ASC LIMIT 1; ```  This query would return the language used by the least number of TV Channels and the count of those channels. Please replace the table and column names with the actual ones in your database.;
 SELECT Language, COUNT(*) FROM TV_Channel GROUP BY Language;
 SELECT Language, COUNT(*) FROM TV_Channel GROUP BY Language;
 SELECT Channel FROM Cartoon WHERE Title = 'The Rise of the Blue Beetle!';
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided database schema does not contain any information about TV channels, TV shows, or cartoons. Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query to answer your question.  Here's a general SQL query structure for retrieving information from a hypothetical table named `TV_SHOWS`:  ```sql SELECT series_name FROM TV_SHOWS WHERE cartoon = 'The Rise of the Blue Beetle'; ```;

 Unfortunately, there is no "TV series" table provided in your schema. Therefore, I cannot generate a SQL query based on the given table schema to answer your question. Please provide the correct table schema with the necessary columns, such as "episode_name", "rating", and "tv_series_name".;
 SELECT MIN(Share), MAX(Share) FROM TV_series;
 SELECT MAX(Share), MIN(Share) FROM TV_series;
 Since there is no table in the provided schema that includes information about TV series episodes, it is not possible to provide a SQL query to answer the given question.  If we assume that the TV series episodes are stored in a table named "Episodes" with the following schema:  CREATE TABLE Episodes ( id text PRIMARY KEY, series_name text, episode_title text, air_date date, FOREIGN KEY(series_name) REFERENCES TV_Channel(series_name) );  Then the SQL query to find the air date of the TV series with the episode "A Love of a Lifetime" would be:  SELECT air_date FROM Episodes WHERE episode_title = 'A Love of a Lifetime';
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the provided table schemas, there is no table that contains information about TV episodes and their air dates. Therefore, it's not possible to provide a SQL query for the given English query.  However, if you have a table named `episodes` with columns `series_name`, `episode_name`, and `air_date`, the SQL query would look like this:  ```sql SELECT air_date FROM episodes WHERE episode_name = 'A Love of a Lifetime'; ```;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the provided table schema, there doesn't seem to be a table related to TV series, episodes, or weekly ranks.

 Given the provided table schema, there is no information regarding countries, TV channels, cartoons, or writers. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a valid SQL query for the given English query.  However, I can provide a hypothetical SQL query based on the assumption that there are tables named `Countries`, `TV_Channels`, `Cartoons`, and `Writers` with appropriate columns and relationships.  Here's the hypothetical SQL query:  ```sql SELECT c.country_name FROM Countries c JOIN TV_Channels ch ON c.id = ch.country_id JOIN Cartoons ca ON ch.id = ca.channel_id JOIN Writers w ON ca.writer_id = w.id WHERE w.writer_name = 'Todd Casey'; ```;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no table that directly or indirectly relates to "countries" or "cartoons on TV" or "written by Todd Casey". Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query based on this information.  However, if you have a table named "cartoons" with columns "country", "on_tv", and "writer", and "writer" can be related to "Todd Casey", the query might look something like this:  ```sql SELECT country FROM cartoons WHERE writer = 'Todd Casey' AND on_tv = true; ```  Please provide the relevant table schema if you need a more accurate query.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided table schema does not contain any information about countries, TV channels, cartoons, or writers. Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query to answer your question.  To answer your question, you would need tables that contain relevant information such as:  1. A table for countries with columns like 'country\_name'. 2. A table for TV channels with columns like 'channel\_name' and 'country\_id' (foreign key referencing the 'countries' table). 3. A table for cartoons with columns like 'cartoon\_name', 'writer\_name', and 'channel\_id' (foreign key referencing the 'TV channels' table).  Once you have these tables, you can write a SQL query to find the countries whose TV channels are not playing any cartoons written by Todd Casey.  If you provide the correct table schema, I can help you generate the appropriate SQL query.;

Therefore, I'm unable to generate a SQL query to answer your question. Please provide the correct table schema or the specific table names that contain the required information.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided table schemas do not contain information about the continents of countries or territories, including Anguilla. Therefore, it's not possible to generate a SQL query to answer your question based on the given table schemas.  However, if you have a table that contains this information, such as a `countries` table with columns like `country_name` and `continent`, you could use a query similar to this:  ```sql SELECT continent FROM countries WHERE country_name = 'Anguilla'; ```  Please provide the relevant table schema if you need a specific SQL query.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the given table schema does not contain any information related to countries or continents. Therefore, it's not possible to provide a SQL query to find the continent name for Anguilla based on the given schema.  To find the continent for a country like Anguilla, you would typically need a table that maps countries to continents. Here's an example of what such a query might look like, assuming you have a table named `Countries` with columns `country_name` and `continent_name`:  ```sql SELECT continent_name FROM Countries WHERE country_name = 'Anguilla'; ```  Please provide the relevant table schema if you need further assistance.;
 Since there is no table named "Region" and the table "Campuses" does not contain information about cities, I cannot provide a query to find the region of the city "Kabul". However, if you want to find the county where a campus is located, you can use the following query:  ```sql SELECT County FROM Campuses WHERE Location = 'Kabul'; ```;

 I'm sorry for the confusion, but there is no "region" or "population" information directly related to "Angola" in the provided table schema. However, assuming that "Angola" is a country and the "state" table contains country information, you might be interested in the "state_name" and "population" columns. If "Angola" is a state within a country, you might want to look at the "state" table. Here's a query to get the population of a specific state:  ```sql SELECT state_name, population FROM state WHERE state_name = 'Angola'; ```;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the given tables (section, Student, Courses, Faculty) do not contain information about regions and populations. Therefore, I cannot provide a SQL query to answer your question about the region of Angola and its population.  You would need a separate table containing country names, their respective regions, and populations. Here's an example of how you might structure such a table:  CREATE TABLE Countries (   Country text PRIMARY KEY,   Region text,   Population number );  And the corresponding SQL query to find the region and population of Angola would be:  SELECT Region, Population FROM Countries WHERE Country = 'Angola';
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no information related to countries, regions, or life expectancy. Therefore, I'm unable to provide a valid SQL query for your request. Please provide the correct table schema or additional information to generate a relevant SQL query.;
 Assuming that the "people" table contains information about people's ages and the "city\_code" column in the "Student" table indicates the location of the students, and that Central Africa is represented by a specific "city\_code", the following query can be used to calculate the average age of people in Central Africa:  `SELECT AVG(Age) FROM people WHERE Nationality = 'Central Africa';`  However, if the "Nationality" column in the "people" table does not contain the specific location of the people, and the "city\_code" column in the "Student" table is used to determine the location of the students, then the following query can be used:  `SELECT AVG(Age) FROM people INNER JOIN Student ON people.People_ID = Student.StuID WHERE Student.city_code = 'Central Africa';`  Please note that these queries assume that the "Nationality" and "city\_code" columns contain the appropriate values to identify people from Central Africa. If this is not the case, the query will need to be adjusted accordingly.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the given tables and the question do not seem to have a direct relationship. The tables provided do not contain information about countries, life expectancy, or continents. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a SQL query to answer the question "What is the name of the country that has the shortest life expectancy in Asia?" based on the provided table schema.  However, if you have a table named "Countries" with columns "Country_Name" and "Life_Expectancy" and another table named "Continents" with columns "Country_Name" and "Continent_Name", you could use a query like this:  ```sql SELECT Country_Name FROM Countries JOIN Continents ON Countries.Country_Name = Continents.Country_Name WHERE Continent_Name = 'Asia' ORDER BY Life_Expectancy ASC LIMIT 1; ```  This query assumes that the "Countries" table has the life expectancy data and the "Continents" table has the continent data for each country. The query joins these tables on the country name, filters for countries in Asia, orders them by life expectancy in ascending order (shortest first), and returns the name of the first country (which has the shortest life expectancy).;
 Unfortunately, there is no table in the provided schema that contains information about countries and their life expectancies. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a valid SQL query to answer the given question.  However, assuming you have a table named `Countries` with columns `name` for the country name and `life_expectancy` for the life expectancy, and another table named `Regions` with columns `country_name` and `region`, you could use a query like this:  ```sql SELECT name FROM Countries WHERE life_expectancy = (SELECT MIN(life_expectancy) FROM Countries WHERE region = 'Asia') AND region = 'Asia'; ```;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but there is no table in the provided schema that contains information about population or GNP, let alone for Asia. Therefore, it's not possible to generate a SQL query to answer your question based on the given schema. Please provide the correct table schema that includes the required data.;

 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided tables (Student, Staff, Lives_in, faculty, and Student) do not contain information about countries, life expectancy, or whether they are republics or not. Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query to answer the given English query.  However, if you have a table named "Countries" with columns "LifeExpectancy", "Continent", and "GovernmentType", the SQL query would look something like this:  ```sql SELECT AVG(LifeExpectancy) FROM Countries WHERE Continent = 'Africa' AND GovernmentType = 'Republic'; ```;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no information about the surface area of the continents. Therefore, it is not possible to write a SQL query to find the total surface area of the continents Asia and Europe.  If you have a table that contains the surface area of the continents, please provide the table schema so I can assist you further.  Here's an example of what the table schema might look like:  CREATE TABLE Continents ( Continent text PRIMARY KEY, SurfaceArea number );  With this table schema, you can write a SQL query to find the total surface area of the continents Asia and Europe:  SELECT SUM(SurfaceArea) FROM Continents WHERE Continent IN ('Asia', 'Europe');
 SELECT SUM(area) FROM state WHERE country_name IN ('Asia', 'Europe');
 Unfortunately, there is no table in the provided schema that represents "people" or "district." Therefore, I cannot provide a valid SQL query to answer the question "How many people live in Gelderland district?"  To answer this question, you would need a table that contains population data for different districts. Once you have that table, you can use a query similar to the following:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM population_table WHERE district = 'Gelderland'; ```;

 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no information about languages used in Aruba or any other location. Therefore, I'm unable to provide a valid SQL query for your request. Please provide the correct table schema or more context to assist you better.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided tables and the English query do not seem to be related. There is no table or information provided about languages spoken in countries. Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query for this question.  However, if you have a table, let's say `countries_languages`, with columns `country_name` and `language`, the SQL query could look like this:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT language) FROM countries_languages WHERE country_name = 'Aruba'; ```  This query assumes that each unique language in the table for Aruba represents a different language spoken in the country.;
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM countrylanguage WHERE CountryCode = 'AFG' AND IsOfficial = 'T';
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM countrylanguage WHERE CountryCode = 'AF' AND IsOfficial = 'T';

 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided table schema does not contain any information about continents or languages. Therefore, I'm unable to generate a SQL query to answer the question "Which continent has the most diverse languages?". Please provide the relevant table schema or modify your question accordingly.;
 Unfortunately, the provided tables do not contain information about continents and languages spoken. Therefore, it's not possible to generate a SQL query to answer the question "Which continent speaks the most languages?".  You need to have a table with information about continents and languages spoken in them to be able to answer this question.  Here's an example of how such a table might look like:  ```sql CREATE TABLE Continents ( id INT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, number_of_languages INT ); ```  With this table, you could use the following SQL query to find the continent that speaks the most languages:  ```sql SELECT name FROM Continents ORDER BY number_of_languages DESC LIMIT 1; ```;

 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided table schemas do not contain information about the continents or the languages spoken. Therefore, it's not possible to generate a SQL query to find the number of distinct continents where Chinese is spoken based on the given table schemas.  However, if you have a table that contains information about continents and languages spoken, the SQL query might look something like this:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT continent) FROM Languages WHERE language = 'Chinese'; ```  Please replace `Languages` with your actual table name, `continent` with the column name that stores the continent information, and `language` with the column name that stores the language information.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided table schemas do not contain information about the number of continents that speak Chinese. Therefore, I cannot generate a SQL query to answer this question.  The provided tables are related to clubs, schools, departments, courses, and students. None of these tables contain information about continents or languages spoken.  To answer this question, you would need a table that contains information about continents and the languages spoken in each one. Once you have that, you could use a query similar to this:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Continent) FROM Languages WHERE Language = 'Chinese'; ```  This assumes that you have a table named `Languages` with columns `Continent` and `Language`. Please replace these with your actual table and column names.;
 SELECT CountryCode FROM countrylanguage WHERE Language IN ('English', 'Dutch');

 Since there is no table in the provided schema that includes information about cities and their populations, I am unable to provide a SQL query for the given English query. However, I can provide a general SQL query that could be used to find the city with the largest population that uses English, assuming you have a table named `cities` with columns `city_name` and `population`, and a table named `languages` with columns `city_name` and `language`.  Here's the SQL query:  ```sql SELECT c.city_name, c.population FROM cities c JOIN languages l ON c.city_name = l.city_name WHERE l.language = 'English' ORDER BY c.population DESC LIMIT 1; ```  This query joins the `cities` and `languages` tables on the `city_name` column, filters for cities that use English, orders the results by population in descending order, and limits the results to the top 1 row. The result will be the city with the largest population that uses English.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no information about cities, populations, or languages spoken. Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query to answer your question. Please provide the relevant table schema or modify your question accordingly.;
 The provided tables do not contain information about the expected life length, so I cannot provide a query to retrieve that data.

Assuming that the country\_name in the state table represents the country and the area represents the area of the country, the query would be: ``` SELECT state_name, population, area FROM state WHERE country_name = 'Asia' ORDER BY area DESC LIMIT 1; ``` Please note that this query assumes that 'Asia' is a valid value for the country\_name column in the state table. If the country\_name is stored differently, you will need to adjust the query accordingly. Also, this query assumes that the area is stored in square kilometers or another unit that can be compared directly. If the area is stored in a different unit, you will need to convert it to a common unit before comparing.;

 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided table schemas do not contain any information related to countries or their areas. Therefore, it's not possible to write a SQL query to answer your question based on these tables.  However, if you have a table named 'countries' with columns 'name' and 'area', you could use a subquery to find the maximum area of any country in Europe and then find all countries with a larger area. Here's an example:  ```sql SELECT name FROM countries WHERE area > (SELECT MAX(area) FROM countries WHERE continent = 'Europe'); ```  Please replace 'name', 'area', and 'continent' with your actual column names if they are different.;
 Unfortunately, the provided tables do not contain information about countries or their populations. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a SQL query to answer the given question based on the provided tables.

It selects the names of African countries with a population less than the population of any country in Asia.;
 This question cannot be answered with the provided table schema as there are no tables related to countries or populations. A possible solution would require a table with the name of the country, its continent, and its population.  For example, if we had a table named `Countries` with the following schema:  ``` CREATE TABLE Countries (     id number PRIMARY KEY,     name text,     continent text,     population number ); ```  The SQL query to find the African countries with a smaller population than that of any country in Asia would be:  ```sql SELECT african_countries.name FROM Countries AS african_countries WHERE african_countries.continent = 'Africa' AND NOT EXISTS (     SELECT 1     FROM Countries AS asian_countries     WHERE asian_countries.continent = 'Asia'     AND asian_countries.population <= african_countries.population ); ```;

 Based on the provided table schema, there is no table that includes information about countries, their continents, and populations. Therefore, it's not possible to generate a SQL query to answer the given English query.  However, assuming you have a table named "Countries" with schema as follows: CREATE TABLE Countries ( Country_ID number PRIMARY KEY, Country_Name text, Continent text, Population number );  Then the SQL query would be: SELECT Country_Name FROM Countries WHERE Continent = 'Europe' AND Population = 80000;
 SELECT SUM(population) AS total_population, AVG(area) AS average_area FROM state WHERE country_name IN (SELECT country_name FROM country WHERE continent = 'North America') AND area > 3000;
 SELECT SUM(population) AS total_population, AVG(area) AS average_surface_area FROM state WHERE country_name = 'North America' AND area > 3000;
 SELECT Name FROM city WHERE Population BETWEEN 160000 AND 900000;
 SELECT Name FROM city WHERE Population BETWEEN 160000 AND 900000;
 SELECT Language FROM countrylanguage WHERE IsOfficial = 'Yes' GROUP BY Language ORDER BY COUNT(CountryCode) DESC LIMIT 1;
 SELECT Language FROM countrylanguage WHERE IsOfficial = 'TRUE' GROUP BY Language ORDER BY COUNT(CountryCode) DESC LIMIT 1;

 SELECT CountryCode FROM countrylanguage WHERE Language = 'Spanish' AND IsOfficial = 'TRUE' AND Percentage = (SELECT MAX(Percentage) FROM countrylanguage WHERE Language = 'Spanish' AND IsOfficial = 'TRUE');
 Based on the provided table schema, there is no table that represents conductors. Therefore, it's not possible to write a SQL query to find the number of conductors. Please provide the correct table schema that includes a table for conductors.;
 Since there is no table named "Conductors" in the provided schema, I cannot provide a query for counting the number of conductors. Please provide the correct table name that contains the data for conductors.;

 Based on the provided table schema, there is no table that seems to contain information about "shares" and "performances" or "performance types". Therefore, it is not possible to generate a valid SQL query based on the given English query.  However, assuming that the relevant information is stored in a hypothetical table called "performances" with columns "share" and "performance\_type", the SQL query would look like this:  ```sql SELECT MAX(share) AS max_share, MIN(share) AS min_share FROM performances WHERE performance_type <> 'Live final'; ```;

 Without knowing the specific table schema for high schoolers, I'm unable to provide an exact query. However, I can give you a general idea of what the query might look like. Assuming you have a table called `Students` with a column `age_group` that categorizes students as high schoolers, the query might look like this:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Students WHERE age_group = 'high schooler'; ```;
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM list WHERE Grade >= 9 AND Grade <= 12;
 SELECT LastName, FirstName, Grade FROM list WHERE Grade >= 9 AND Grade <= 12;
 SELECT STU_FNAME, STU_LNAME, STU_GPA FROM STUDENT WHERE STU_CLASS = 'High School';
 SELECT Highschooler.grade, ENROLL.ENROLL_GRADE FROM Highschooler JOIN ENROLL ON Highschooler.ID = ENROLL.STU_NUM;
 Given the provided table schema, there is no direct way to find the grade of each high schooler as there is no table that directly associates students with their grades. However, assuming that the grade of a student can be derived from the courses they are enrolled in and the grades they have received, we can write a query to join the relevant tables.  Here's a query that assumes there is a table called "Enrollment" that associates students with their enrolled classes and a table called "Grades" that stores the grades received by students in their enrolled classes.  ```sql SELECT Student.StuID, Student.LName, Student.Fname, Gradeconversion.lettergrade FROM Student JOIN Enrollment ON Student.StuID = Enrollment.StuID JOIN CLASS ON Enrollment.CLASS_CODE = CLASS.CLASS_CODE JOIN Grades ON Enrollment.StuID = Grades.StuID AND Enrollment.CLASS_CODE = Grades.CLASS_CODE JOIN Gradeconversion ON Grades.gradepoint = Gradeconversion.gradepoint WHERE Student.Major = 'High School'; ```;
 SELECT grade FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle';
 The provided tables do not contain any information about high schoolers, grades, or a high schooler named Kyle. Therefore, I cannot provide a valid SQL query for the given English query. Please provide the correct table schema for generating the SQL query.;
 SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM list WHERE Grade = 10;
 SELECT name FROM Highschooler WHERE grade = 10;
 SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle';
 I cannot provide Kyle's id as there is no table containing information about individuals' names and corresponding ids. However, assuming that 'Kyle' is a player and 'player_id' is the id, you can find Kyle's id using the following query:  ```sql SELECT player_id FROM player WHERE player_name = 'Kyle'; ```  Please note that this query assumes that there is a 'player_name' column in the 'player' table. If the 'player' table does not have a 'player_name' column, you will need to modify the query accordingly.;
 Unfortunately, there is no table in the provided schema that contains information about high schoolers or their grades. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a valid SQL query to answer the given question. Please provide the correct table schema with the required information.;
 Without knowing the specific table schema that contains the information about high schoolers and their grades, I'm unable to provide a precise SQL query. However, assuming there is a table named `students` with columns `student_id`, `grade`, and `school_type`, the following query could be used:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM students WHERE grade IN (9, 10) AND school_type = 'High School'; ```;
 SELECT Grade, COUNT(*) as NumberOfHighSchoolers FROM Students INNER JOIN list ON Students.last_name = list.LastName AND Students.first_name = list.FirstName WHERE Grade >= 9 AND Grade <= 12 GROUP BY Grade;
 Assuming there is a table named "high_schoolers" with a column named "grade", the SQL query to find the number of high schoolers in each grade would be:  `SELECT grade, COUNT(*) FROM high_schoolers GROUP BY grade;`  However, based on the provided table schema, there is no table that contains information about high schoolers or their grades. Therefore, the query cannot be executed with the given table schema.;
 SELECT lettergrade, COUNT(*) as count FROM Student JOIN Student_Course_Enrolment ON Student.StuID = Student_Course_Enrolment.Student_ID JOIN Sections ON Student_Course_Enrolment.Section_ID = Sections.section_id JOIN Courses ON Sections.course_id = Courses.course_id JOIN Gradeconversion ON Student_Tests_Taken.test_result = Gradeconversion.lettergrade WHERE Courses.course_type = 'High School' GROUP BY lettergrade ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 1;
 SELECT lettergrade FROM Gradeconversion WHERE gradepoint = (SELECT MAX(gradepoint) FROM Gradeconversion);
 SELECT ENROLL_GRADE, COUNT(STU_NUM) as student_count FROM ENROLL GROUP BY ENROLL_GRADE HAVING student_count >= 4;
 This query cannot be answered directly as there is no information about the high schoolers or their grades in the provided tables. However, assuming that the 'Student' table contains high schoolers and their grades are stored in the 'Gradeconversion' table, you can use the following query:  ```sql SELECT lettergrade FROM Gradeconversion WHERE gradepoint IN (SELECT gradepoint FROM Student WHERE Age >= 14 AND Age <= 18 GROUP BY gradepoint HAVING COUNT(*) >= 4); ```  Please note that this query assumes that high schoolers are aged between 14 and 18. You may need to adjust the age range based on your specific context. Also, this query assumes that there is a relationship between the 'Student' and 'Gradeconversion' tables, which is not explicitly defined in the provided schema.;
 SELECT student_id, friend_id FROM Friend;
 Unfortunately, there is no information about a "friends" table or any relationship that indicates friendship in the provided schema. Therefore, it's not possible to write a query to find out how many friends each student has based on the given schema.  If you have a table that shows friend relationships, such as a `Friends` table with columns like `StudentID` and `FriendID`, you could write a query to count the number of friends for each student. But based on the provided schema, this information is not available.;
 SELECT H.name, COUNT(F.ID) as friend_count FROM Highschooler H LEFT JOIN Highschooler F ON H.ID != F.ID AND H.grade = F.grade WHERE H.ID IN (SELECT student_id FROM Friend) GROUP BY H.name;
 SELECT H.name, COUNT(L.liked_id) as friend_count FROM Highschooler H LEFT JOIN Likes L ON H.ID = L.student_id GROUP BY H.name;
 SELECT H.name FROM Highschooler H JOIN (SELECT friend_id, COUNT(*) as friend_count FROM Friend GROUP BY friend_id) F ON H.ID = F.friend_id ORDER BY friend_count DESC LIMIT 1;
 Assuming that the number of friends is determined by the number of rows in the Lives_in table for each dorm, and that the high school students are identified by the Major field in the Student table, the SQL query would be:  `SELECT s.LName, s.Fname FROM Student s JOIN (SELECT dormid, COUNT(*) as friend_count FROM Lives_in GROUP BY dormid) l ON s.StuID = l.stuid WHERE s.Major = 'high school' ORDER BY l.friend_count DESC LIMIT 1;`;
 SELECT H.name FROM Highschooler H WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Highschooler H2 WHERE H2.ID IN (SELECT H3.ID FROM Highschooler H3 WHERE H3.ID IN (SELECT H4.ID FROM Highschooler H4 WHERE H4.ID = H.ID OR H4.ID IN (SELECT F.ID FROM Friend F WHERE F.ID1 = H.ID OR F.ID2 = H.ID)))) >= 3;
 SELECT H1.name FROM Highschooler H1 WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Highschooler H2 WHERE H1.ID <> H2.ID AND H1.ID IN (SELECT H3.StuID FROM Has_Pet H3 WHERE H3.PetID = H2.ID) OR H1.ID IN (SELECT H4.StuID FROM Has_Pet H4 WHERE H4.PetID = H2.ID)) >= 3;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided tables don't seem to include a 'high schooler' entity or a 'friends' relationship. Therefore, it's not possible to generate a SQL query based on the given information to answer the question about "Show the names of all of the high schooler Kyle's friends."  If you have additional tables or information that can help answer this question, please provide them.;
 SELECT Highschooler.Name FROM Highschooler JOIN Friend ON Highschooler.ID = Friend.friend_id WHERE Friend.student_id = (SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE Name = 'Kyle');
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no direct way to determine the number of friends for a high school student named Kyle. The provided tables do not have a "friends" relationship or any information about friendships. Therefore, I cannot provide a valid SQL query to answer your question.  However, if there were a table named "friends" with a structure like this:  CREATE TABLE friends (     student_id number,     friend_id number,     FOREIGN KEY(student_id) REFERENCES Student(StuID),     FOREIGN KEY(friend_id) REFERENCES Student(StuID) );  Then, you could use the following query to find the number of friends for a high school student named Kyle:  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM friends WHERE student_id IN (SELECT StuID FROM Student WHERE Fname = 'Kyle' AND Major IN (SELECT Major FROM school WHERE School = 'High School'));
 "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Highschooler WHERE name IN (SELECT name FROM Highschooler WHERE name = 'Kyle') AND ID IN (SELECT ID FROM Visits_Restaurant WHERE StuID IN (SELECT StuID FROM Visits_Restaurant WHERE name = 'Kyle'));";
 SELECT student_id FROM Students WHERE student_id NOT IN (SELECT student_id FROM Friend) AND student_id NOT IN (SELECT friend_id FROM Friend);
 SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT student_id FROM Friend);
 SELECT name FROM Highschooler WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT friend_id FROM Friends);
 The provided schema does not contain a table that represents "friends" or any relationship between students to determine friendships. Therefore, it's not possible to generate a query to find students who have no friends based on the given schema.  However, if there were a table named 'Friends' with a structure like this:  CREATE TABLE Friends (   StudentID1 number,   StudentID2 number,   FOREIGN KEY(StudentID1) REFERENCES Student(StuID),   FOREIGN KEY(StudentID2) REFERENCES Student(StuID) );  Then the SQL query to find students who have no friends could look like this:  "SELECT LName, Fname FROM Student WHERE StuID NOT IN (SELECT StudentID1 FROM Friends UNION SELECT StudentID2 FROM Friends);";
 SELECT H.ID FROM Highschooler H WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Friend F WHERE F.student_id = H.ID) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Likes L WHERE L.liked_id = H.ID);
 SELECT Likes.student_id FROM Likes JOIN Friend ON Likes.student_id = Friend.student_id;
 SELECT H.name FROM Highschooler H WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Friend WHERE student_id = H.ID) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Likes WHERE liked_id = H.ID);
 SELECT H.name FROM Highschooler H WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Highschooler F WHERE F.ID != H.ID AND H.ID IN (SELECT Likes FROM Highschooler WHERE ID = F.ID)) AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM Highschooler L WHERE L.ID != H.ID AND L.ID IN (SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE Likes = H.ID));
 SELECT student_id, COUNT(liked_id) as like_count FROM Likes GROUP BY student_id;
 SELECT student_id, COUNT(liked_id) FROM Likes GROUP BY student_id;
 Assuming that the "likes" are stored in a separate table named "Likes" with a column "student_id" referring to the student who has the like, and a column "like_count" to store the number of likes, the SQL query could look like this:  ```sql SELECT s.LName, s.Fname, COUNT(l.student_id) as like_count FROM Student s JOIN Likes l ON s.StuID = l.student_id WHERE s.Age < 19 GROUP BY s.StuID, s.LName, s.Fname; ```  This query will return the last name, first name, and the number of likes for each high school student (assuming students under 19 are high schoolers). Please replace the table and column names with your actual table and column names if they are different.  Please note that the table schema provided in the question does not contain information about "likes". Therefore, I made an assumption about the existence of a "Likes" table. If the schema for tracking likes is different, you would need to adjust the query accordingly.;
 SELECT s.LName, s.Fname, COUNT(l.liked_id) as NumberOfLikes FROM Student s JOIN Likes l ON s.StuID = l.student_id GROUP BY s.StuID, s.LName, s.Fname;
 SELECT name FROM Highschooler WHERE ID = (SELECT student_id FROM Likes GROUP BY student_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1);
 Assuming there is a "likes" column in the "list" table, the SQL query would be:  `SELECT LastName, FirstName FROM list ORDER BY likes DESC LIMIT 1;`  However, there is no "likes" column in any of the provided tables. Please provide the correct table schema or information about the "likes" column.;
 SELECT LName, Fname FROM Student WHERE StuID IN (SELECT student_id FROM Likes GROUP BY student_id HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2);
 Without knowing the table schema for storing student likes, it is impossible to provide a valid SQL query. Please provide the relevant table schema to generate the correct SQL query.;
 SELECT LastName, FirstName FROM list WHERE Grade > 5 AND LastName IN (SELECT LastName FROM list GROUP BY LastName HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2);
 SELECT name FROM Highschooler WHERE grade > 5 AND ID IN (SELECT ID FROM Highschooler WHERE ID IN (SELECT Friend1 FROM Friend WHERE Friend2 = ID) OR ID IN (SELECT Friend2 FROM Friend WHERE Friend1 = ID) GROUP BY ID HAVING COUNT(ID) >= 2);
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but there seems to be no table in the provided schema that contains a column named "likes" or any information related to likes. Therefore, I cannot generate a SQL query to find out how many likes Kyle has. Please provide the correct table schema with the necessary information.;
 Since there is no table in the provided schema that directly links a high schooler named Kyle to a number of likes, I cannot provide a valid SQL query for this request.  However, if there is a table (e.g., `likes`) that has a foreign key (e.g., `StudentID`) referencing the `Student` table and a column (e.g., `LikeCount`) to store the number of likes, the SQL query would look like this:  ```sql SELECT LikeCount FROM likes WHERE StudentID = (SELECT StuID FROM Student WHERE Fname = 'Kyle'); ```  Please adjust the table and column names according to your actual database schema.;
 Assuming that the "friends" relationship is defined in the "People" table, and there is a "grade" column in the "People" table, the SQL query would be:  `SELECT AVG(grade) FROM People WHERE person_id IN (SELECT person_id FROM People WHERE friend_id IS NOT NULL);`  Please note that this query assumes that the "friend_id" column in the "People" table is used to store the IDs of friends. If the "friends" relationship is defined differently, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.  Also, the given schema does not include a "grade" column in the "People" table. If the "grade" is stored in a different table, the query would need to be adjusted to join that table.  Finally, the given schema does not include a "friend_id" column in the "People" table. If the "friends" relationship is defined in a different way, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly.  If the schema does not match, please provide the correct schema so that I can give you the appropriate query.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but there seems to be no "grade" column in the provided tables. To find the average grade of students who have friends, you would need a table that contains friend relationships and grades.  Assuming you have a table named "Friends" with columns "StudentID1" and "StudentID2" to represent friend relationships, and a table named "Grades" with columns "StudentID" and "Grade" to store grades, the SQL query would look like this:  ```sql SELECT AVG(G.Grade) FROM Grades G WHERE G.StudentID IN (SELECT F.StudentID1 FROM Friends F UNION SELECT F.StudentID2 FROM Friends F); ```  Please replace the table and column names with the actual ones in your database.;
 SELECT MIN(Grade) FROM Enrolled_in e INNER JOIN Student s ON e.StuID = s.StuID WHERE s.StuID NOT IN (SELECT student_id FROM Friend UNION SELECT friend_id FROM Friend);
 SELECT MIN(grade) FROM Highschooler WHERE ID NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT friend FROM Highschooler WHERE friend IS NOT NULL);
 Based on the provided table schema, there is no table that directly provides information about states, owners, and professionals. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a valid SQL query for the given English query.  However, if we assume that the "city\_code" column in the Student table represents the state and that there are separate tables for owners and professionals with a foreign key referencing the Student table, we could write a query like this: ```vbnet SELECT DISTINCT city_code FROM Student WHERE StuID IN (SELECT StuID FROM Owners) AND StuID IN (SELECT StuID FROM Professionals); ``` This query selects the distinct city\_codes (assuming they represent states) of students who are both owners and professionals. However, this query is purely hypothetical and may not work with the actual table schema.;
 Assuming there is a table named "City" with columns "city_code" and "state", and the tables "Owner" and "Professional" with the column "city_code", the SQL query would be:  ```sql SELECT DISTINCT state FROM City WHERE city_code IN (SELECT city_code FROM Owner) AND city_code IN (SELECT city_code FROM Professional); ```  Please note that I had to make assumptions about the existence of tables "Owner", "Professional", and "City", as well as their structure, since they were not provided in the given information.  Also, I assumed that "states" in the English query refers to "state" in the "City" table, and "owners" and "professionals" refer to the "Owner" and "Professional" tables, respectively.  If the table schema does not match, please provide the correct table schema for the "Owner", "Professional", and "City" tables, and I will adjust the SQL query accordingly.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but there seems to be no table related to dogs or treatments in the provided schema. Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query based on the given information. Please provide the correct tables and their schema to generate the required SQL query.;
 SELECT AVG(Dogs.age) FROM Dogs JOIN Treatments ON Dogs.dog_id = Treatments.dog_id;
 SELECT p.person_id AS id, p.last_name AS last_name, p.cell_mobile_number AS cell_phone FROM People p JOIN Student s ON p.person_id = s.Advisor WHERE s.city_code = 'Indiana' OR s.Major > 2;
 SELECT person_id, last_name, cell_mobile_number FROM People WHERE address_line_1 = 'Indiana' OR treatments_performed > 2;
 SELECT Dogs.dog_name FROM Dogs LEFT JOIN Treatments ON Dogs.dog_id = Treatments.dog_id GROUP BY Dogs.dog_name HAVING SUM(Treatments.cost_of_treatment) <= 1000;
 SELECT Dogs.name FROM Dogs WHERE Dogs.dog_id NOT IN (SELECT Treatments.dog_id FROM Treatments WHERE Treatments.cost_of_treatment > 1000);
 SELECT Name FROM driver WHERE Name NOT IN (SELECT breed_name FROM Breeds);  Note: The query assumes that 'Name' in the 'driver' table represents the first name and 'breed_name' in the 'Breeds' table represents dog names. If this is not the case, the query will need to be adjusted accordingly.;
 Based on the provided table schema, there is no table that represents professionals, owners, or dog names. Therefore, I cannot generate a SQL query for the given English query.  However, if we assume that the required information is stored in the following tables: - `professionals` table with columns `id` and `first_name` - `owners` table with columns `id` and `first_name` - `dogs` table with columns `id` and `first_name`  Then the SQL query to find the first names that are used for professionals or owners but are not used as dog names would be:  ```sql SELECT first_name FROM (   SELECT first_name FROM professionals   UNION ALL   SELECT first_name FROM owners ) AS names WHERE first_name NOT IN (SELECT first_name FROM dogs); ```;
 "SELECT professional_id, role, email FROM Professionals WHERE professional_id NOT IN (SELECT professional_id FROM Treatments);";

 SELECT owner_id, first_name, last_name FROM Owners WHERE owner_id IN (SELECT owner_id FROM Dogs GROUP BY owner_id ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1);
 Unfortunately, there is no table in the provided schema that contains information about professionals or treatments. Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query for the given English query. Please provide the correct table schema or the necessary information to write the SQL query.;
 The provided tables do not contain information about professionals, their roles, or treatments. Therefore, I cannot generate a SQL query based on the given table schema to answer the question: "What are the id, role, and first name of the professionals who have performed two or more treatments?"  However, assuming there is a table named `Professionals` with columns `ID`, `Role`, `FirstName`, and another table named `Treatments` with a column `ProfessionalID` linking to the `Professionals` table, the SQL query would look like this:  ```sql SELECT ID, Role, FirstName FROM Professionals WHERE ID IN (SELECT ProfessionalID FROM Treatments GROUP BY ProfessionalID HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2); ```;
 Assuming there is a table named Dogs with a foreign key breed_code referencing Breeds, the query would be:  SELECT breed_name FROM Breeds WHERE breed_code = (SELECT breed_code FROM Dogs GROUP BY breed_code ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1);
 Since there is no table in the provided schema that contains information about the number of dogs per breed, it's impossible to provide a SQL query that answers the question.  However, if we assume that there is a table named `Dogs` with a foreign key `breed_code` referencing `Breeds` table, the SQL query could look like this:  ```sql SELECT breed_name FROM Breeds WHERE breed_code = (SELECT breed_code FROM Dogs GROUP BY breed_code ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1); ```  This query assumes that the `breed_code` with the highest count in the `Dogs` table corresponds to the breed with the most dogs. The subquery `SELECT breed_code FROM Dogs GROUP BY breed_code ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT 1` retrieves the `breed_code` of the breed with the most dogs, and the main query retrieves the `breed_name` of that breed.;
 SELECT d.owner_id, o.last_name, SUM(t.cost_of_treatment) as total_cost FROM Dogs d JOIN Owners o ON d.owner_id = o.owner_id JOIN Treatments t ON d.dog_id = t.dog_id GROUP BY d.owner_id, o.last_name ORDER BY total_cost DESC LIMIT 1;
 SELECT dog_owners.owner_id, dog_owners.last_name FROM Dog_Owners JOIN Dogs ON Dog_Owners.owner_id = Dogs.owner_id JOIN Treatments ON Dogs.dog_id = Treatments.dog_id GROUP BY Dog_Owners.owner_id, Dog_Owners.last_name ORDER BY SUM(Treatments.cost_of_treatment) DESC LIMIT 1;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the provided table schemas do not contain any information related to "treatment type" or "costs". Therefore, it is not possible to generate a valid SQL query for the given English query. Please provide the relevant table schema(s) to generate the appropriate SQL query.;
 This task seems to be a bit tricky as the provided table schemas do not contain any columns related to "treatment type" or "total cost". Therefore, I'm unable to generate a SQL query that meets your requirements.  However, assuming there is a table named `treatment` with columns `type` and `cost`, the SQL query could look like this:  ```sql SELECT type, MIN(total_cost) FROM (SELECT type, SUM(cost) as total_cost FROM treatment GROUP BY type) as subquery; ```  Please provide the correct table schema if this is not the case.;
 SELECT owner_id, zip_code FROM Owners WHERE owner_id IN (SELECT owner_id FROM Payments GROUP BY owner_id ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC LIMIT 1);

 SELECT professional_id, cell_phone FROM professionals WHERE professional_id IN (SELECT professional_id FROM treatments GROUP BY professional_id HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT treatment_type) >= 2);
 Assuming that "professionals" refer to Physicians and "types of treatments" refer to Medications, the query would look something like this:  ```sql SELECT P.EmployeeID, Pat.Phone FROM Physician P JOIN Prescribes PRE ON P.EmployeeID = PRE.Physician JOIN Patient Pat ON PRE.Patient = Pat.SSN GROUP BY P.EmployeeID, Pat.Phone HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT PRE.Medication) >= 2; ```  This query joins the Physician, Prescribes, and Patient tables to find physicians who have prescribed two or more distinct medications, and then retrieves their IDs and cell phone numbers. Please note that the table schema does not include a column for "cell phone" in the Physician table, so I assumed it is stored in the Patient table. If it is stored in a different table, you will need to adjust the query accordingly.;
 SELECT first_name, last_name FROM Professionals WHERE professional_id IN (SELECT professional_id FROM Treatments WHERE cost_of_treatment < (SELECT AVG(cost_of_treatment) FROM Treatments));

 I'm sorry for the confusion, but it seems that there is no table in your schema that directly connects dogs, breeds, and treatment dates. However, based on the information provided, I can give you a general idea of how the query might look like if such tables existed:  ```sql SELECT breed_name, treatment_date FROM Dogs JOIN Breeds ON Dogs.breed_code = Breeds.breed_code JOIN Treatments ON Dogs.dog_id = Treatments.dog_id WHERE breed_name IN (SELECT breed_name FROM Breeds GROUP BY breed_name ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC LIMIT 1); ```  Please replace `Dogs`, `Treatments`, and the column names with your actual table and column names. This query assumes that there is a `Dogs` table with a `breed_code` foreign key referencing `Breeds.breed_code`, and a `Treatments` table with a `dog_id` foreign key referencing `Dogs.dog_id`. The subquery is used to find the rarest breed.;
 SELECT Owners.first_name, Dogs.dog_name FROM Owners JOIN Dogs ON Owners.owner_id = Dogs.owner_id WHERE Owners.state = 'Virginia';
 SELECT Owners.first_name, Dogs.name FROM Owners INNER JOIN Dogs ON Owners.owner_id = Dogs.owner_id WHERE Owners.state = 'Virginia';
 Unfortunately, there is no table in the provided schema that contains information about the arriving date and the departing date of dogs. Therefore, I cannot provide a valid SQL query to answer your question. Please ensure that the necessary table and columns are present in the schema before attempting to retrieve data.  If you have the necessary table and columns, the SQL query would look something like this:  ```sql SELECT dog_id, MIN(date_of_treatment) AS arriving_date, MAX(date_of_treatment) AS departing_date FROM Treatments GROUP BY dog_id; ```  This query assumes that the earliest treatment date for a dog is the arriving date and the latest treatment date is the departing date.;
 Based on the provided table schema, there is no table that contains information about the arriving date and departing date of the dogs. Therefore, it is not possible to generate a valid SQL query to answer the given English query.  However, if we assume that the "date\_of\_treatment" column in the "Treatments" table represents the date when the dog received the treatment, then we can modify the English query to find the date of treatment for each dog that received a treatment. Here's the SQL query for that:  `SELECT dog_id, date_of_treatment FROM Treatments;`  This query will return a list of dog\_ids and their corresponding treatment dates.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no direct relationship between the provided tables and the query about the "youngest dog" and its "owner's last name." The tables provided are about students, breeds, dorm amenities, and people, but there's no table that directly links to dogs and their owners.  However, if we assume that the "people" table represents dog owners and the "Breeds" table represents dog breeds, and we also assume that there's a table named "Dogs" with columns "owner_id" and "breed_code", we could write a query like this:  ```sql SELECT p.LastName FROM People p INNER JOIN Dogs d ON p.People_ID = d.owner_id INNER JOIN Breeds b ON d.breed_code = b.breed_code WHERE d.birth_date = (SELECT MIN(d.birth_date) FROM Dogs d); ```  This query assumes that the "People" table has a column "LastName" and the "Dogs" table has a column "birth_date". Please provide the correct table schema if this assumption is incorrect.;
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but there seems to be no table in the provided schema related to pets or dogs.

 Assuming there is a table named "owners" with columns "first_name", "last_name", and "email", and there is a table named "states" with columns "state_name" and "owner_id" where "owner_id" is a foreign key to the "owners" table:  SELECT first_name, last_name, email FROM owners WHERE owner_id IN (SELECT owner_id FROM states WHERE state_name LIKE '%North%');  If the table schema does not match, please provide the correct schema.;
 The provided tables do not contain any information about dogs, so I cannot provide a query for that specific question. However, I can provide a general query structure for counting the number of records in a table where a certain condition is met.  Assuming there was a table named `Dogs` with columns `DogID` (Primary Key), `Name`, and `Age`, the query to count the number of dogs with an age below the average would look like this:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Dogs WHERE Age < (SELECT AVG(Age) FROM Dogs); ```;
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Pets WHERE PetType = 'dog' AND pet_age < (SELECT AVG(pet_age) FROM Pets WHERE PetType = 'dog');
 I'm sorry for the confusion, but based on the given table schema, there is no table that contains information about treatments and their costs. Therefore, I cannot generate a valid SQL query to answer the question "How much does the most recent treatment cost?". Please provide the relevant table schema or information to generate the correct SQL query.;
 SELECT MAX(cost) FROM treatment WHERE treatment_date = (SELECT MAX(treatment_date) FROM treatment);

 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Dogs WHERE dog_id NOT IN (SELECT dog_id FROM Treatments);
 This query assumes that there is a table named "Owners" and a table named "Dogs" with a relationship between them, where each owner can have multiple dogs, and each dog belongs to one owner. The schema is not provided, so I'm making these assumptions based on common patterns.  To find the number of owners who temporarily do not have any dogs, you can use a LEFT JOIN and a COUNT query:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT o.owner_id) FROM Owners o LEFT JOIN Dogs d ON o.owner_id = d.owner_id WHERE d.owner_id IS NULL; ```  Please replace "owner\_id" and "dog\_id" with the appropriate column names in your schema. If the schema does not match, you will need to adjust the query accordingly.;
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Owners WHERE owner_id NOT IN (SELECT owner_id FROM Dogs);
 SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Professionals WHERE professional_id NOT IN (SELECT professional_id FROM Treatments);
 SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT professional_id) FROM Professionals WHERE professional_id NOT IN (SELECT professional_id FROM Treatments);

 I'm sorry for the confusion, but the query you're asking for is not clear. The English query "How many available features are there in total?" is too vague and doesn't specify which features or tables you're referring to.  If you're asking about the total number of columns across all tables, you can use the following query:  ```sql SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT column_name FROM user_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'MUSIC_FESTIVAL' UNION ALL SELECT column_name FROM user_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'ARTIST' UNION ALL SELECT column_name FROM user_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'SINGER' UNION ALL SELECT column_name FROM user_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'SINGER_IN_CONCERT' UNION ALL SELECT column_name FROM user_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'ALBUMS'); ```  Please note that this query is based on Oracle syntax, as it uses the `user_tab_columns` data dictionary view. If you're using a different database system, the syntax might be slightly different.  If you meant something else by "features", please provide more context or clarify your question.;
